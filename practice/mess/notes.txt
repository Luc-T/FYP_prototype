installed matplotlib https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html

installed SciPi https://scipy.org/install/

Used this https://likegeeks.com/3d-plotting-in-python/
to find out how to display 3d graph in python

TODO

atm code makes graph with first pop shown. Finds 5 elites, generates 5 brand new members.
Problem- cant update display by replotting scatters. 
Plan- instead focus on GA rather than interface, actually mutate elites instead of making new members
Make it modular, so it can loop multiple times, come back to matplotlib?

sort pop by fitness -done?
generate new pop
    mutate function in class
    take either x1 or x2 ... or both
    mutate it (increase or decrease value by a certain amount)

create crossover function
    got sorted pop
    decide on elites, top half with some exceptions, random chance for a higher fitness to not survive/ low to survive. 
    Replace chosen half with copies of 'fitter' half. Mutate copies.
    Chance for copy to be completely new ??? <- this could go in mutate function idk
	
	
	
__update 02/04__
creates pop of 10, sorts by fitness, keeps fittest 5, copies them, modifies copy. No sophistication, such as fittest having multiple copies, randomness that fit candidate isnt chosen etc. 
Mutation could be further changed. It's just change, x1, or x2, or both. Or chance of replacing with brand new candidate. Have more option? Chance of small step or large step? atm its just 50/50 + or - of rnd(0.0-1.0)

Need alternate version. Reproduce via two parents. See crossover thoughts.
Need to implement matplotlib, update graph with different scatters from new populations/Button to click next pop. <- less important than the GA itself
